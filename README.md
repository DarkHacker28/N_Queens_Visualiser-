N-Queens Visualizer

Overview:
The N-Queens Visualizer is a web-based application designed to illustrate the classic N-Queens problem. This problem involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The application visually demonstrates the process of solving this problem, making it a valuable educational tool for understanding backtracking algorithms.

Features :
Interactive Visualization: Watch the algorithm as it places each queen on the board and backtracks when necessary.
Customizable Board Size: Input any value of N to see solutions for different board sizes.
Step-by-Step Execution: Follow the algorithm's decision-making process in real-time.
Highlighting and Animation: Visual cues and animations help to understand how the algorithm works.


Technologies Used :
HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling the application and making it visually appealing.
JavaScript: For implementing the logic of the N-Queens algorithm and controlling the visualization.

How to Use
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n-queens-visualizer.git
cd n-queens-visualizer

Open the Application:
Open index.html in your web browser to launch the visualizer.

Input Board Size:
Enter the desired board size (N) in the input field provided.

Start Visualization:
Click the "Start" button to begin the visualization of the algorithm solving the N-Queens problem.
